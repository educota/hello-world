# hello-world
tutorial

In this tutorial I am trying to get used with GitHub.
So far I learned how to create a repository and how to create a copy (branch) the master branch.

"Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time."

Using a branch can help edit the repository without compromising the original version of the project
